# CppMake
# A CMake utility library to introduce some sanity into CMake scripting such as:
# - static typing
# - automatic dependency retrieval from vcpkg, conan, and/or git
# - dependency include scrape
# - automatic dependency binary copying to build/install dir (for dependencies not properly configured)
