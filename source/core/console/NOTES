Libraries that provide console formatting:

ncurses (*nix only, GPL) https://invisible-island.net/ncurses
PDcurses (cross-platform, may be dead, license unclear) https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses
Termcolor (BSD 3-clause, new) https://github.com/ikalnytskyi/termcolor
Rang (Unlicense, may be dead) https://github.com/agauniyal/rang

Note: for Rang, had to change OS_XYZ macros to avoid macro collisions
Using termcolor for now, may merge a little bit of rang code and then remove the latter
